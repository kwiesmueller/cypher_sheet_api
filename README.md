# Cypher Sheet API

This repository contains backend services supporting the
[cypher_sheet](https://github.com/kwiesmueller/cypher_sheet) app.

Currently two projects can be found here:

* `discord_bot`: A bot able to read objects shared from the app printing them
  as Discord embeds.
* [VERY-WIP] `character_service`: The first steps to an API for syncing characters
  with a remote service.

Check the respective directories to learn more about the respective components.

The repository also contains some tools to deploy the above services to
Kubernetes.

## Contributing

Note that all of this is written in Rust right now. Mostly as a personal
learning experience. If you would like to contribute feel free to reach out
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/2jXQmFSKtm).

If you'd like to contribute in a different language than Rust, don't feel held
back. Any help is appreciated.
